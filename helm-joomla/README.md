# Joomla Helm Chart (Work in Progress)

This repository contains documentation and resources for an article about building a basic Helm chart for Joomla.

> ⚠️ **Please note:** This is a work in progress, and likely always will be. The goal is to create a simple but useful Joomla Helm chart that others can use, learn from, or build upon. It's not made by professionals — just my best effort, shared in the hope that it might help someone else.

💬 **Feedback is very welcome** — ideas, suggestions, questions, bug reports, or even a quick "hi" are all appreciated. Collaboration makes things better.

Thanks for stopping by!
